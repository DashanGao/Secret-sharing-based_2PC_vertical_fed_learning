# Secret-sharing-based_2PC_vertical_fed_learning
A three-party secret-sharing-based vertical federated learning setting. The data are vertically partitioned in two parties. A semi-honest third party is leveraged for secure federated learning.

To run the code, open and run the `run_secret_sharing_vertically_linear_regression.py` file.
